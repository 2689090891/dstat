Dstat is a versatile replacement for vmstat, iostat and ifstat. Dstat
overcomes some of the limitations and adds some extra features.

Dstat allows you to view all of your system resources instantly,
you can eg. compare disk usage in combination with interrupts from
your IDE controller, or compare the network bandwidth numbers
directly with the disk throughput (in the same interval).

Dstat also cleverly gives you the most detailed information in
columns and clearly indicates in what magnitude and unit the output
is displayed. Less confusion, less mistakes, more efficient.

Dstat is unique in letting you aggregate block device throughput for
a certain diskset or network bandwidth for a group of interfaces, ie.
you can see the throughput for all the block devices that make up a
single filesystem or storage system.

Dstat allows its data to be directly written to a CSV file to be
imported and used by OpenOffice, Gnumeric or Excelto create graphs.

Since it's practically impossible to test dstat on every possible
permutation of kernel , python or distribution version, I need your
help and your feedback to fix the remaining problems.
