### Usability
+ Use /etc/dstat.conf to influence output
+ Add --config option
+ Add -o/--output option
+ Make -I eth0,acpi or -I ide0,yenta work
+ Show header when out of display instead of 22 lines (see term ?)
+ Maybe add colors to indicate units better (may become ugly)
+ Allow to force to given magnitude

### Extensions
+ Add all stats to seperate modules and allow people to plugin their own modules

### Statistics
+ Add application stats ( -a or -A pid,cmd)
+ Add ip stats (icmp, tcp, udp)
+ Add ntp stats
+ Add user stats (number of users logged on)
+ Add --diff option to print intermediate results (ie. when delay = 5, you see 1sec updates in other color)
+ Look into interfacing with bind, sendmail, postfix, squid, amavisd, 
+ Look into interfacing with laus

### Bugs
+ Implement protection against counter rollovers
