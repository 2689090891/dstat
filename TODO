### Usability
+ Add --config option and use /etc/dstat.conf to influence output
+ Allow to force to given magnitude
+ Look at possibilities to show deviation (on second line ?)
+ Find a way to use curses without the flickering and tty clearing in screen
+ Detect terminal capabilities (colors, ANSI) using curses (?)
+ Re-implement -I eth0,eth1

### Export/Graph
+ Add -o/--output option to save directly to a file
+ Interface with rrdtool

### Extending statistics (help welcome!)
+ Add all stats to seperate modules and allow people to plugin their own modules
+ Add icmp, nfs, ntp stats ?
+ Add user stats (number of users logged on)
+ Add application stats (-a or -A pid,cmd)
+ Look into interfacing with apps (bind, sendmail, postfix, squid, amavisd, laus, samba)
+ Look into interfacing with specific HW counters in /proc
+ Look at /proc/slabinfo, /proc/meminfo, /proc/locks, /proc/mdstat, /proc/vmstat

### Documentation (help welcome!)
+ Improve manpage
+ Create document on general system performance tuning
  (explaining the different values in /proc, especially the concerning ones)
+ Create document on general system performance tools
  (explaining the different uses of tools like dstat, iostat, pmap, strace, tcpdump)

### General bugs
+ Backport all changes to dstat15
+ Timer is not accurate on 2.6 kernel, every second there's a 1ms deviation (every 17mins -> 1sec)

### Stat bugs
+ tcp stat is very slow and generates lots of softirqs (on some systems)
+ Implement better (?) protection against counter rollovers
+ Fix bug with: ./dstat -tit -I 177

### Redesign (v2.0)
+ Create modules that can contain samples of different units

   CPU: (see mpstat)
	sys, usr, idl, iow, hiq, siq (percentage)
      	intr/sec (int)
	
   IO: (see iostat -x)
	tps (int)
	blk_read/sec, blk_wrtn/sec (kB/sec)

+ Design proper object model
