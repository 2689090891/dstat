### Usability
+ Add --config option and use /etc/dstat.conf and ~/.dstat to influence output (see example dstat.conf)
+ Allow to force to given magnitude (--unit=kilo)
+ Look at possibilities to show deviation (on second line ?)
+ Check for dark/light background color and change colors accordingly (see dstat.conf)

### Export/Graph
+ Interface with rrdtool (python-rrd ?)
+ Allow for different types of export modules (only CSV now)

### Extending statistics (help welcome!)
+ Add slab stats (see /proc/slabinfo and slabtop)
+ Add xorg stats (xdpyinfo, xrestop)
+ Add icmp, nfs, ntp stats ?
+ Add application stats (-a or -A pid,cmd)
+ Add user stats (number of users logged on, utmp is not that useful, /proc/key-users)
+ Look into interfacing with apps (bind, sendmail, postfix, squid, amavisd, laus, samba)
+ Look into interfacing with specific HW counters in /proc
+ Look at /proc/meminfo, /proc/mdstat, /proc/netstat, /proc/snmp, /proc/vmstat
+ Allow for SNMP counters to be added

### Documentation (help welcome!)
+ Improve manpage
+ Create document on general system performance tuning
  (explaining the different values in /proc, especially the concerning ones)
+ Create document on general system performance tools
  (explaining the different uses of tools like dstat, iostat, pmap, strace, tcpdump)

### General bugs
+ Timer is not accurate on 2.6 kernel, every 1 seconds there's a 0.8ms deviation (every 21mins -> 1sec)
+ Python 1.5 prints 'L' for long, crashes when int()
+ If number of lines on terminal <= 1, division by zero

### Stat bugs
+ Implement better (?) protection against counter rollovers
+ tcp stat is very slow and generates lots of softirqs (on some systems), to be confirmed
+ proc stats (run, blk and new) does not work on 2.4.30 (possibly 2.4.x), to be confirmed
+ proc stats seem to be off-by-one (some of the time)

### Redesign (v2.0)
+ Create modules that can contain samples of different units

   CPU: (see mpstat)
	sys, usr, idl, iow, hiq, siq (percentage)
      	intr/sec (int)
	
   IO: (see iostat -x)
	tps (int)
	blk_read/sec, blk_wrtn/sec (kB/sec)

+ Design proper object model and namespace for _all_ possible stats
