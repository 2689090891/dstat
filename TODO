### Usability
+ Add --config option and use /etc/dstat.conf to influence output
+ Add -o/--output option and parsable output options
+ Allow to force to given magnitude
+ Look at possibilities to show deviation (on second line ?)

### Extensions
+ Add all stats to seperate modules and allow people to plugin their own modules

### Statistics
+ Add application stats (-a or -A pid,cmd)
+ Add ip stats (icmp, tcp, udp)
+ Add ntp stats
+ Add user stats (number of users logged on)
+ Look into interfacing with bind, sendmail, postfix, squid, amavisd, laus, gpfs, hw ?

### Bugs
+ Implement better (?) protection against counter rollovers
+ If you have 2 devices with the same name, -I will only work on the first one
