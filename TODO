### Usability
+ Add --config option and use /etc/dstat.conf to influence output
+ Allow to force to given magnitude
+ Look at possibilities to show deviation (on second line ?)
+ Improve manpage
+ I should be able to detect when ANSI sequences are not possible (anyone?)

### Export/Graph
+ Add -o/--output option to save directly to a file
+ Add --parse option to give parsable output (maybe CSV output ?)
+ Interface with rrdtool

### Extending statistics (help welcome!)
+ Add all stats to seperate modules and allow people to plugin their own modules
+ Add application stats (-a or -A pid,cmd)
+ Add mpstat information (-C 0,1,2)
+ Add icmp stats ?
+ Add ntp stats
+ Add user stats (number of users logged on)
+ Look into interfacing with apps (bind, sendmail, postfix, squid, amavisd, laus, samba)
+ Look into interfacing with specific HW counters in /proc

### Bugs
+ Implement better (?) protection against counter rollovers
+ If you have 2 devices with the same name, -I will only work on the first one
+ When using -D foo, -I 99, -N eth9 dstat should fail when it does not exist 
+ cpu is avg of begin and end snapshot, not avg of intermediate results (already better than vmstat though)
+ proc stat is a snapshot in time, not avg of intermediate results
+ The number of newly created processes in the proc stat easily exceeds the allocated space (2 chars)
+ OverflowError: float too large to convert (in conv()) still not fixed in all cases
+ Timer is not accurate on 2.6, every second there's a 1ms deviation (every 17mins -> 1sec)
