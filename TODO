### Usability
+ Add --config option and use /etc/dstat.conf to influence output
+ Allow to force to given magnitude
+ Look at possibilities to show deviation (on second line ?)
+ Improve manpage
+ I should be able to detect when terminal has no ANSI capabilities (anyone?)
+ Implement -I eth0,eth1 again

### Export/Graph
+ Add -o/--output option to save directly to a file
+ Add --parse option to give parsable output (maybe CSV output ?)
+ Interface with rrdtool

### Extending statistics (help welcome!)
+ Add all stats to seperate modules and allow people to plugin their own modules
+ Add application stats (-a or -A pid,cmd)
+ Add icmp stats ?
+ Add ntp stats
+ Add nfs stats
+ Add user stats (number of users logged on)
+ Look into interfacing with apps (bind, sendmail, postfix, squid, amavisd, laus, samba)
+ Look into interfacing with specific HW counters in /proc

### General bugs
+ If you have 2 devices with the same name, -I will only work on the first one
+ When using -D foo, -I 99, -N eth9 dstat should fail when it does not exist 
+ Timer is not accurate on 2.6 kernel, every second there's a 1ms deviation (every 17mins -> 1sec)

### Stat bugs
+ tcp stat is very slow and generates lots of siq (on some systems)
+ proc stat seems to be off by one, no clue why
+ Implement better (?) protection against counter rollovers
